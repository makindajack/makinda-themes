# TODO — Multi-Editor Port

Tracking the expansion of Makinda Themes from VS Code-only to a cross-editor theme suite. See [SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md), [IDES.md](IDES.md), and [THEMES.md](THEMES.md) for context.

> **Companion repo:** icon design lives in `~/Downloads/01.GitHub/makinda-icons` (`makinda-icons`). Out of scope for this checklist; tracked separately.

## Phase 0 — Foundation

- [x] Extract palette from current VS Code JSONs into `source/palette.json`
- [x] Define semantic token map in `source/tokens.json` (mirrors [THEMES.md](THEMES.md))
- [x] Add a Node validator (`build/validate.mjs`) that flags theme colors not in the palette
- [x] Wire `npm run validate` / `npm run validate:strict` into `package.json`
- [x] Resolve all stragglers — `npm run validate:strict` is green for both variants
- [x] Add a Node build script (`build/vscode.mjs`) that regenerates the VS Code themes from `source/vscode/{light,dark}.json`
- [x] Verify generated VS Code JSON is byte-identical to the hand-tuned files
- [x] Add `npm run build` and `npm run check` (validate + contrast audit)
- [x] Repo layout decided: `themes/` + `package.json` stay at the root **(this is the VS Code port)**; every other port lives under `ports/<editor>/`. Moving `themes/` would force a marketplace path change for zero functional gain.

## Phase 1 — VS Code polish (current port)

- [ ] Audit contrast on every `editor.foreground` vs `editor.background` pair (target AA on UI, AAA on text)
- [ ] Fix Light theme `editorLineNumber.activeForeground` so the current line is unambiguous
- [ ] Verify Dark theme `terminal.ansi*` slots match [THEMES.md](THEMES.md) ANSI table
- [ ] Add semantic token coverage for: TypeScript decorators, Rust lifetimes, Python `self`, Go receiver types
- [ ] Add screenshots to `images/` for: TS, Python, Rust, Go, Markdown, JSON, HTML/JSX
- [ ] Publish to **Open VSX** (mirror of VS Code Marketplace) so VSCodium / Cursor / Windsurf users get auto-updates

### Marketplace migration (`makinda-dark` → `makinda-themes`)

The Dark variant used to ship as the standalone extension `makindajack.makinda-dark`. Now that both variants live together in `makindajack.makinda-themes`, the old listing has to be retired. See [PUBLISHING.md → Migrating from `makinda-dark`](PUBLISHING.md#migrating-from-makinda-dark-one-time) for steps.

- [ ] Push a final `makinda-dark` patch release whose README points users to `makinda-themes` (optional but friendly)
- [ ] **Unpublish `makindajack.makinda-dark`** from the VS Code Marketplace (publisher portal)
- [ ] Confirm only `makinda-themes` is listed at <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/makindajack>
- [ ] Publish the latest `makinda-themes` (after build script lands) to VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX
- [ ] Update marketplace README screenshots to show both Light and Dark

## Phase 2 — Adjacent VS Code ecosystem

- [x] Cursor — works as-is via VS Code extension
- [x] Windsurf — works as-is
- [ ] Document install steps for Cursor / Windsurf in `INSTALLATION.md`
- [ ] Add a "Compatible editors" section to `README.md`

## Phase 3 — JetBrains

- [ ] Scaffold `ports/jetbrains/` Gradle plugin project (`gradle-intellij-plugin`)
- [ ] Generate `Makinda Light.icls` (editor color scheme) from source
- [ ] Generate `Makinda Light.theme.json` (UI theme) from source
- [ ] Same pair for Dark
- [ ] Test in IntelliJ IDEA Community
- [ ] Test in WebStorm, PyCharm, GoLand, RustRover, Rider, Android Studio
- [ ] Write `plugin.xml` with both themes registered
- [ ] Submit to JetBrains Marketplace

## Phase 4 — Sublime Text

- [ ] Scaffold `ports/sublime/`
- [ ] Generate `Makinda Light.sublime-color-scheme` from source
- [ ] Generate Dark variant
- [ ] Add `messages.json` and `package.json` for Package Control
- [ ] Submit to Package Control

## Phase 5 — Zed

- [ ] Scaffold `ports/zed/extension.toml`
- [ ] Generate `themes/makinda.json` containing both variants
- [ ] Test in Zed
- [ ] Submit to Zed extension registry

## Phase 6 — Neovim & Vim

- [ ] Scaffold `ports/neovim/lua/makinda/`
- [ ] Generate `init.lua` with `setup({ variant = "light" | "dark" })`
- [ ] Cover Treesitter highlight groups
- [ ] Cover LSP semantic tokens
- [ ] Cover diagnostics, gitsigns, telescope, nvim-tree/neo-tree, lualine
- [ ] Generate Vim fallback `colors/makinda-light.vim` and `colors/makinda-dark.vim`
- [ ] Cterm (256-color) fallback table
- [ ] README install instructions for lazy.nvim / packer / vim-plug

## Phase 7 — Xcode

- [ ] Scaffold `ports/xcode/`
- [ ] Generate `Makinda Light.xccolortheme` (plist) from source
- [ ] Generate Dark variant
- [ ] Manual install script `install.sh`
- [ ] README with screenshots in Xcode

## Phase 8 — Helix

- [ ] Generate `ports/helix/makinda_light.toml`
- [ ] Generate `ports/helix/makinda_dark.toml`
- [ ] Submit upstream PR to Helix's `runtime/themes/` directory

## Phase 9 — Terminals

- [x] iTerm2 — `ports/iterm2/Makinda Light.itermcolors`, `…Dark.itermcolors`
- [x] Warp — `ports/warp/makinda_light.yaml`, `…dark.yaml`
- [x] Alacritty — `ports/alacritty/makinda_light.toml`, `…dark.toml`
- [x] Kitty — `ports/kitty/makinda_light.conf`, `…dark.conf`
- [ ] WezTerm — `ports/wezterm/makinda.lua`
- [x] Windows Terminal — JSON snippet in `ports/windows-terminal/`
- [ ] Ghostty — theme file in `ports/ghostty/`

## Phase 10 — Backlog (Tier 3)

- [ ] Emacs `makinda-theme.el`
- [ ] Visual Studio (full) `.vssettings`
- [ ] TextMate `.tmTheme`
- [ ] Notepad++ XML
- [ ] Eclipse `.epf`
- [ ] BBEdit, Nova, Lapce
- [ ] Slack, Discord (BetterDiscord), Obsidian CSS

## Cross-cutting fixes

- [ ] Add CI (GitHub Actions): lint JSON, run build, run contrast check
- [ ] Add `scripts/contrast-check.mjs` — fails on AA violations for body text
- [ ] Add screenshot generator (Playwright + a reference snippet) to keep marketing PNGs in sync
- [ ] Single `release.mjs` that bumps version across every port and tags

## Known issues to fix

Surfaced by `npm run contrast` (WCAG 2.1):

- [ ] Light `syntax.comment` `#9ca3af` on `#ffffff` — **2.54 : 1** (need 4.5). Darken to ~`#6b7280` or similar.
- [ ] Light `syntax.function` `#f05106` on `#ffffff` — **3.57 : 1** (need 4.5). Use a darker accent for code text (e.g. `#c73b07`); keep the brighter shade for decorative UI only.
- [ ] Dark `syntax.comment` `#6b7280` on `#0e0e0f` — **3.99 : 1** (need 4.5). Lighten to ~`#7d8593`.
- [ ] Dark `fg.inverse` (`#ffffff`) on `brand.primary` `#ff6b0d` — **2.85 : 1** (need 3.0 for UI text). Either darken brand or switch inverse text on brand to a near-black.

Other:

- [ ] Light theme: orange on white can vibrate at small font sizes — consider a slightly darker brand variant for inline accents (`#d94405`?)
- [ ] Dark theme: terminal cursor color blends into selection on some terminals
- [ ] Inconsistent comment color between Light (`#9ca3af`) and Dark (`#6b7280`) — confirm intentional vs. swap

**Next up:** Phase 1 — VS Code polish: fix the four contrast failures above, then ship to Open VSX so VSCodium / Cursor / Windsurf get auto-updates.
